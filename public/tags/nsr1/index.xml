      <description>Cove is based on my experience in residency at the Hambidge Center in winter 2023; this collection of work uses field recordings from throughout Hambidge. Some of these feature saw playing in different locations on the campus, some are based on work in my residency studio, and the last track is a live performance in Chicago from April 2023.&#xA;Toby Kaufmann-Buhler (based in Lafayette, Indiana) explores history, memory, identity and sensory perception in relation to his family and himself, within individual lives and across broad sweeps of history and culture.</description>

      <description>“Marylou Was a Bookkeeper” is a recording of travel logs by Marylou Sutton that I found after her passing. Stapled and handwritten on spiral notebook paper, the journal details the logistics of a mysterious roadtrip across the US from Georgia to Washington. Despite her attention to finances and mileage, the logs are are not dated with a year, but are believed to document a trip made with her husband, brother-in-law and and sister-in-law…most likely in 1983.</description>

      <description>Urusonēto is a sound work by the french artist Wladimir Schall based on the Ursonate, also known as Sonata in Urlauten or the &amp;ldquo;Sonate of primitive sounds&amp;rdquo;, a phonetic poem composed between 1922 and 1932 by Kurt Schwitters and influenced by his meeting with Raoul Hausmann in 1921 in Prague, where he saw him reciting his poem &amp;ldquo;FMSBW&amp;rdquo;. (&amp;gt;See RH&amp;rsquo;s phonetic poems on Erratum Musical in 2019).&#xA;Wladimir Schall did not start reciting the poem himself, but preferred to entrust the task to &amp;ldquo;someone else&amp;rdquo;: the japanese voice of google translate.</description>

      <description>“After several years of not doing anything since Erstwhile first asked me to do a solo album, I suddenly had the idea to record it last week and it was released within a week or so.&#xA;I know some of you are thinking “Anyone can do this…”, but in the DIY spirit of doing what anyone can do with what anyone can get, and without any special skills or funds, I tackled improvisation head on, using mostly newspapers and cardboard boxes, which turned out to be this triple CD set.</description>

      <title>&#34;Music For The Loud Air Conditioner&#34;</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/archive/music-for-the-loud-air-conditioner/</link>

      <description>Throughout May, 2020 the air conditioner outside my studio window in Austin, Texas went nuts. It was so loud that it was audible from the street, almost 200 meters away. Normally, my studio windows looked out onto a hectare of woods with birds and plants etc. Now everything was just the air conditioner.&#xA;There was no way to work without the air conditioner (the daytime heat would reach as high as 39 degrees Celsius), so I had to find a way to work with the air conditioner.</description>
