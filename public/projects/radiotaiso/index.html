      <p>Radio calisthenics (ラジオ体操, rajio taisō, literally, &ldquo;radio exercises&rdquo;) are warm-up calisthenics performed to music and guidance from radio broadcasts. Originating from the United States, they are popular in Japan and parts of China, North Korea and Taiwan.</p>
<p>In Japan, radio calisthenics are broadcast to music on public NHK radio and television early in the morning, and is a rare example of a sponsored program in the NHK (the sponsor being the Japan Post Insurance Co.). Rajio taisō were introduced to Japan in 1928 as a commemoration of the enthronement of Emperor Hirohito; an employee of the Japanese postal insurance division (predecessor to the Japan Post Insurance Co.)—originally dispatched to MetLife to study the insurance system in the US—found out of the Tower Health Exercises and immediately brought samples of the exercises from MetLife back to Japan. The exercises were widely used to improve the overall health of the Japanese soldiers both at home and abroad during the 1930s and 1940s. The exercises were introduced to several other pacific nations, including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia during Japan&rsquo;s colonization period.</p>
<p>After Japan&rsquo;s defeat in 1945, the broadcasts were banned by the occupying powers for being too militaristic in nature.</p>
<p>After several rewrites to the exercise routine, it was reintroduced by NHK radio in 1951 with the support of the education ministry, health ministry, the Japan Gymnastic Association and the Japan Recreation Association.</p>
<p>Radio taisō is still used at schools as a warm up for physical education classes and during sports day activities. It is also implemented by some companies as a way of building morale and a sense of group unity, as well as to raise energy levels and encourage good health.</p>
