      <description>Radio calisthenics (ラジオ体操, rajio taisō, literally, &amp;ldquo;radio exercises&amp;rdquo;) are warm-up calisthenics performed to music and guidance from radio broadcasts.

      <description>In February, 1982, Ralph Records contacted Mr. Penn Jillette, a nationally known entertainer and announcer, to see if he was interested in Ralph&amp;rsquo;s 10th Anniversary Radio Special. The format of the special, as specified in Mr. Jillette&amp;rsquo;s contract, was unusual, but the salary was sufficient, so Mr. Jillette agreed.&#xA;At 8:00 AM on Monday, March 1, Mr. Jillette entered room 312 of the Bentley Motor Inn at 465 Grove Street (directly across the street from the Ralph Headquarters) in San Francisco.</description>

      <description>Hello Dummy! is a comedy album released by American comedian Don Rickles. It was recorded at the Sahara Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, and released in 1968. It peaked at No. 54 on the Billboard Top LPs music chart.&#xA;In a retrospective review, Jason Ankeny of AllMusic rated Hello Dummy! explained that Rickles &amp;ldquo;steadfastly remains a true equal-opportunity offender, spitting out insults with the speed and force of a rivet gun and without regard to gender, race, creed, or sexuality&amp;rdquo; and that &amp;ldquo;Hello Dummy!</description>

      <description>No Soap Radio is a custom built, modular, and portable radio station designed to be installed in an art space, and either operated in person, or set to transmit automatically. Inspired by what Radio Artist Tetsuo Kogawa calls “narrowcasting”, No Soap Radio claims a part of the underutilized AM spectrum for conceptual, experimental, and radical sound art. By broadcasting to a niche audience on a format mostly abandoned by commercial stations, No Soap Radio is a form of performance art, and stands in contrast to corporate or community stations - because the goal is not to attract advertisers or provide news, entertainment, and information, but, instead, to create a venue for unexpected and experiential work in a non-traditional space.</description>
