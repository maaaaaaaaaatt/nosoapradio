      <description>Urusonēto is a sound work by the french artist Wladimir Schall based on the Ursonate, also known as Sonata in Urlauten or the &amp;ldquo;Sonate of primitive sounds&amp;rdquo;, a phonetic poem composed between 1922 and 1932 by Kurt Schwitters and influenced by his meeting with Raoul Hausmann in 1921 in Prague, where he saw him reciting his poem &amp;ldquo;FMSBW&amp;rdquo;. (&amp;gt;See RH&amp;rsquo;s phonetic poems on Erratum Musical in 2019).&#xA;Wladimir Schall did not start reciting the poem himself, but preferred to entrust the task to &amp;ldquo;someone else&amp;rdquo;: the japanese voice of google translate.</description>

      <description>Throughout May, 2020 the air conditioner outside my studio window in Austin, Texas went nuts. It was so loud that it was audible from the street, almost 200 meters away. Normally, my studio windows looked out onto a hectare of woods with birds and plants etc. Now everything was just the air conditioner.&#xA;There was no way to work without the air conditioner (the daytime heat would reach as high as 39 degrees Celsius), so I had to find a way to work with the air conditioner.</description>

While we’re open to any and all types of audio, we’re primarily interested in work that adopts and adapts AM radio as a format, and uses its particular intricacies (low fidelity, mono, etc.</description>

      <description>No Soap Radio is a custom built, modular, and portable radio station designed to be installed in an art space, and either operated in person, or set to transmit automatically. Inspired by what Radio Artist Tetsuo Kogawa calls “narrowcasting”, No Soap Radio claims a part of the underutilized AM spectrum for conceptual, experimental, and radical sound art. By broadcasting to a niche audience on a format mostly abandoned by commercial stations, No Soap Radio is a form of performance art, and stands in contrast to corporate or community stations - because the goal is not to attract advertisers or provide news, entertainment, and information, but, instead, to create a venue for unexpected and experiential work in a non-traditional space.</description>
