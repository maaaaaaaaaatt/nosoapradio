No Soap Radio is a custom built, modular, and portable radio station designed to be
installed in an art space, and either operated in person, or set to transmit automatically. Inspired by what Radio Artist Tetsuo Kogawa calls “narrowcasting”, No Soap Radio claims a part of the underutilized AM spectrum for conceptual, experimental, and radical sound art. By broadcasting to a niche audience on a format mostly abandoned by commercial stations, No Soap Radio is a form of performance art, and stands in contrast to corporate or community stations - because the goal is not to attract advertisers or provide news, entertainment, and information, but, instead, to create a venue for unexpected and experiential work in a non-traditional space.


We host regular exhibitions of experimental works of sound, new media, and transmission arts. To submit work, ask questions, or otherwise get in touch, please email [studio@no-soap.net](mailto:studio@no-soap.net).
