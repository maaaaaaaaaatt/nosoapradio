## OPEN CALL, SPRING 2024

No Soap Radio invites artists to submit work to our inaugural group exhibition to be held April 1 - May 15, 2024.

We are seeking work that challenges conventions of sound art, and investigates how the medium of broadcast can become activated through creative experimentation. While we’re open to any and all types of audio, we’re primarily interested in work that adopts and adapts AM radio as a format, and uses its particular intricacies (low fidelity, mono, etc.) as an advantage.

To apply, please send up to three (3) audio files (formatted as .mp3, .wav, or .aac), an artist statement, and short bio to studio@no-soap.net with the subject line 2024 Spring Open Call.

This exhibition will be broadcast from our transmitter in Knoxville, Tennessee and streamed online 24/7 at no-soap.net.
