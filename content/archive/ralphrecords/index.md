In February, 1982, Ralph Records contacted Mr. Penn Jillette, a nationally known entertainer and announcer, to see if he was interested in Ralph's 10th Anniversary Radio Special. The format of the special, as specified in Mr. Jillette's contract, was unusual, but the salary was sufficient, so Mr. Jillette agreed.

At 8:00 AM on Monday, March 1, Mr. Jillette entered room 312 of the Bentley Motor Inn at 465 Grove Street (directly across the street from the Ralph Headquarters) in San Francisco. The door was locked behind him.

Mr. Jillette was to spend the next six days alone in this room. Each day he received a new package of records from Ralph. His job was to listen to and comment on these recordings.

The Ralph Records 10th Anniversary Radio Special was compiled from more than 50 hours of tape recorded while Mr. Jillettte was alone in his motel room.
