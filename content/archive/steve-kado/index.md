Throughout May, 2020 the air conditioner outside my studio window in Austin, Texas went nuts. It was so loud that it was audible from the street, almost 200 meters away. Normally, my studio windows looked out onto a hectare of woods with birds and plants etc. Now everything was just the air conditioner.

There was no way to work without the air conditioner (the daytime heat would reach as high as 39 degrees Celsius), so I had to find a way to work with the air conditioner. These recordings are efforts to collaborate with the air conditioner, to hear it as a friend.
